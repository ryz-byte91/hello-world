Hello! I am a 29 year old married mother of one. I am an animal lover as well as all things technology. I have always considered myself a nerd and am very proud of that title. This is my first whack at coding or programming at all and I am loving it already. I can't wait to learn lots and maybe make some money on the way! =D
